    Thanks for your note concerning the subject agreement.  I'm wondering if it
    might be more straightforward if we just replace the affected sections of
    the form of contract Enron previously provided. ( In preparing the suggested
    changes I followed the structure (and headings) of that form.)   With
    respect to "OTHER TERMS",  I suggest that the first three paragraphs in the
    last version could be replaced.

    The suggested changes are reproduced below for ease of reference and use.
    Note that the final paragraph anticipates the insertion of a Contract Number
    by Enron.

    Regards;

    Michael Kleiner
    Law Department


    TIER OF GAS:  As specified in OTHER TERMS, below.
    DCQ (IN MMBTUS):  An amount between 0 MMbtu per day and 20,000 MMbtu per
    day, as specified in OTHER TERMS, below.
    DELIVERY POINT:   The interconnect of ANR Pipeline Co. (Joliet) and Alliance
    Pipeline Limited  ("Alliance") provided that Customer will use reasonable
    efforts to arrange deliveries to alternate downstream pipelines as Company
    may request in accordance with the procedures specified in OTHER TERMS,
    below.
    .........
    OTHER TERMS:

    In this Agreement, "Customer's AOS" shall mean Customer's right to utilize
    Authorized Overrun Service on Alliance by virtue of that agreement between
    Customer and Alliance providing Customer with 51.1 MMcf per day of Alliance
    firm capacity, but does not include Customer's right to utilize Authorized
    Overrun Service that is announced as available to Customer after 9:00 am
    Mountain Time on the Nomination Day; and

    "Gas Day" has the meaning given to that term in the U.S. tariff for Alliance
    pipeline.

    "Nomination Day" means the business day immediately preceding a particular
    Gas Day.

    On each Nomination Day, by  9:00 am Mountain Time  Customer will advise
    Company by telephone or voice mail whether Customer will deliver and sell
    gas hereunder on the next Gas Day and the amount to be delivered in MMBtus .
    That amount shall be the DCQ for the next Gas Day, in all other
    circumstances the DCQ will be zero.  The decision to sell and deliver gas
    hereunder shall be within Customer's sole discretion, however, Customer
    agrees that it shall not utilize Customer's AOS to deliver gas to a buyer in
    Chicago except to Company pursuant to this Agreement, provided that Customer
    may utilize Customer's AOS for operational purposes such as and including
    balancing its Alliance account.

    Once DCQ for the next Gas Day has been determined as provided in the
    preceding paragraph such gas shall be considered to be Tier 3 Firm Gas and
    the Force Majeure provision of the Enfolio Spot General Terms and Conditions
    shall not apply to such deliveries.

    By 9:45 am Mountain Time on each Nomination Day  that the DCQ for the next
    Gas Day is not zero, Company shall advise Customer in writing or via e-mail
    of the contract numbers, associated gas volumes, and alternate downstream
    pipelines, if any,  where it wishes to have the DCQ allocated on the next
    Gas Day. If Company fails to provide such advice in respect of the entire
    DCQ  by 9:45 am,  Company will be conclusively deemed to have allocated the
    entire DCQ to Contract No. ______________.   Promptly thereafter, Customer
    will place a nomination with Alliance in accordance with such allocation.

    Michael,
    Grant Oh of the Calgary office seems to be okay with your
    requested
    modification of the interrruptible spot confirm.  As such, please
    prepare
    an amendment document to add your language as an Appendix to the
    terms of
    the spot confirm, have it signed and forward to Grant Oh and myself
    for
    approval.  Thereafter we will have it signed and by Enron and will
    return a
    fully executed copy to you.

    Dan, Bruce Kohrs of Keyspan left me a message this weekend with
    respect to
    the schedule 'A' that they would like attached.  Assuming that the
    central
    desk has agreed to the contents of schedule 'A' - and they have been
    involved in drafting this document - I don't see a lot of commercial
    risk,
    especially given the lack of 'damages' in the event of any defaults
    to
    schedule 'A'.  My understanding was that we would all work together
    on a
    reasonable efforts basis to allow gas to flow daily.  They contents
    of
    schedule 'A' and its true enforceability does not seem to really
    change the
    spirit of the agreement.
    If they are really adamant about including the schedule 'A', and the
    central desk has reviewed and expressly agreed to its contents, then
    I
    would not object to including the schedule 'A' as part of the
    contract.

    Grant
