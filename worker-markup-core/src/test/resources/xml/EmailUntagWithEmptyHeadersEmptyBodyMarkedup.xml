    As far as providing the purchase order number, should we send that to P. O.
    Box 4428, Attn:  Client Services since it won't be on the contract?

    Christian,
    I spoke with Janet Wallis this morning and she said she was fine with
    the redlined changes.  Accordingly, please print 2 originals of the
    contract, have it signed and forward both signed contracts to Janet Wallis
    for ENA's signature.

    Christian,
    The below documents has been modified in the manner that you
    suggested.  Please make sure that the Purchase Order Number is communicated
    to all parties in writing prior to the end of the month if it is to be
    used.  The red line should reflect  the changes that you have  been
    requesting.  By copy I am requesting Janet Wallis to review the suggested
    changes and to communicate directly with you if she approves such changes.
    If she notifies you that the changes are okay, then you may print 2
    originals of the clean document and have it signed by CPS and forward to
    Janet for signature by ENA.  Do not hesitate to call if you have any
    questions.   My phone number is (713) 853-6895.
