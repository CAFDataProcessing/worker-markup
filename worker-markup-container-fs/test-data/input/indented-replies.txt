By chance was the "green light" ever provided for the move out of redacted.com to new.redacted.com domain?  Appreciate the help here.

    Thanks Dan,
    
    Hope we take action soon to move out of redacted.com to new.redacted.com domain. This
    may stop working on Oct 31 or some day. Who are the OpenVPM admins?
    
    Thanks
