 Hewlett Packard Enterprise reports Q2 FY16 results
 
To: All HPE employees
 
Today, HPE announced its Q2 earnings, our best performance since I joined the company in 2011. We also announced plans for a tax-free spin-off and merger of our Enterprise Services business with CSC, a $6 billion IT services company. To read more about both of these announcements, visit HPE News Now.
 
Please join the Executive Council and me for an All Employee Meeting tomorrow, Wednesday, 25 May where we will talk more about todayâ€™s announcements and answer your questions.
 
I look forward to talking with you tomorrow.
 
Best,
Meg
