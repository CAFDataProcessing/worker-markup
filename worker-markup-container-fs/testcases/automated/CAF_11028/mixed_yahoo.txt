Mikhail, 
Can you add the db initialization to initpolicydb.sh script

Please, note that I have added two new containers in Aspen Deploy: boilerplate and boilerplate-administration.
NOTE: In order for them to start correctly, new DB schema should be installed. For instructions refer to ASP -1615.
Also NOTE that you can exclude these containers from deployment,  just specify additional    –x “boilerplate”  when start deploy-workers.sh
                          Regards, MIkhail
 
P.S.
Here the instructions for your convenience:
 
 
Re-name and run  attached JAR with next arguments:
(Replace 00.000.00.000 with host IP where Postgres is installed, update password if required )
$ java -jar boilerplate-db-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar -db.connection jdbc:postgresql://00.000.00.000:5432 -db.name boilerplate -db.pass redacted -db.user redacted
ostgres -fd
 
In command prompt you should see: 
 
about to perform DB installation from scratch.
Created new database: boilerplate
About to perform DB update.
DB update finished.
 
Check that "boilerplate" DB actually exist
 
 
 
 
<boilerplate-db-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar.rename>
