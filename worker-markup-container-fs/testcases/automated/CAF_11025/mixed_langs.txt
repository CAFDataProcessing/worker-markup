Action May Be Required

The OpenVPN project is continuing with HPE. As such, the DNS names associated with the gateways need to be changed along with outstanding software environment updates.

Changes will be effected to the osprey gateway first starting November 29, 2016. All users should be connecting to osprey before this time or they will experience connectivity issues. After the changes have been applied, a new announcement will be sent out for users to resume using the osprey gateway.

Please direct any questions/discussion to the openvpn community mailing list -- openvpn.community@lists.com<mailto:openvpn.community@lists.com>

The OpenVPN administrators.
