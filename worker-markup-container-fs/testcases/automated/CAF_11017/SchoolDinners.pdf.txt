More schools sign up for healthy
meals
The Council’s success in transforming school meals in
the borough has been underlined this month. Two
more schools – including a local private school - have
opted to sign up for the service.
Who has signed up?
Eltham Green specialist sports college, a comprehensive
school with 940 pupils, has opted to terminate its school
meals contract with a private catering contractor and
bring in the Council to run the service from 1 October.
Riverston school, an independent day school with 350
pupils, has contracted the Council’s catering service to
supply its school meals starting later this month.
The contract with Riverston is the first time the Council
has been asked to supply school meal services to a
private school.

local schools.
Popular menus
Greenwich Council Leader Chris Roberts said, "It is very
encouraging that Riverston and Eltham Green schools
have asked the Council to supply their school meals,
and I am sure the parents at both of those schools will
appreciate the commitment that the schools are
showing to their children’s health.
"There has already been a great deal of enthusiasm for
the new menus among parents and teachers, all of
whom recognise the importance for children’s health of
a balanced diet.
"The new meals have also proved very popular with
pupils, despite dire warnings at the initial stages that
children would rebel over losing their chips and
burgers."
More choice
For the new term, the healthy menus have expanded
with four weeks worth of meals now available on
rotation.
