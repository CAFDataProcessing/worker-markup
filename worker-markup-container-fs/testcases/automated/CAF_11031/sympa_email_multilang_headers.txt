*Asunto:* Had to reimage my ubuntu workstation.....

 

Last week I reimaged my Ubuntu workstation.  After installing 16.04 I'm trying
to get OpenVPN working today.  I'm at the office, needed to physically enter
our lab, but I'd like to get OpenVPN running while I'm here.

 

I noticed that some the configuration info still references HP.  Is this still
right?

 

I also noticed that one can't get the certificates anymore.  They see to be
locked over at HP rather than accessible from HPE.

 

Any help would be appreciated,

 

Mike
