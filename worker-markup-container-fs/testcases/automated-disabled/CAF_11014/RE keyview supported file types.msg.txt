Hi Sylvain,
                The attached lists from pg193-224 the formats (and level of support) in KeyView.

I hope this is sufficient.

Thanks
Andy

Sure…we will copy accordingly…that will be helpful indeed…

Currently observed in Aspen that nsf and ost archive files are not getting extracted…I assume nsf extraction needs lotus notes configuration…not sure how it should work in Linux box (we earlier did in Windows box)…


WR,

Shubhendhu, you can probably share the data set and list of issues encountered so far?

Do you have a set we could add to our own to validate? I’ll also see if I can get a set from the Keyview teams ghost.

Andy,

Do you have a list of file types officially supported and qualified by CAF processing?

PS: the answer cannot be ‘whatever keyview supports’ J
