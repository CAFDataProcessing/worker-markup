# Markup Worker Disabled Automated Test Cases

These testcases are currently not running as part of the nightly build as they require regeneration following changes in CAF-3229. There is also an investigation ongoing into time differences in field values that could affect hashing so for now we are delaying updating regeneration of these test cases to avoid regenerating them multiple times.
