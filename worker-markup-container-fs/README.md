# Markup Worker Container FS

This is a prepackaged Docker image containing the Markup Worker (worker-markup) that uses a File System based data store.

More information on the functioning of the Markup Worker is available [here](../README.md).

## Container Deployment and Configuration

The Markup Worker can be deployed using the compose file [here](https://github.hpe.com/caf/data-processing-service-deploy). For instructions on how to deploy using the compose file see the [Data Processing Getting Started Guide](https://pages.github.hpe.com/caf/data-processing-service/pages/en-us/Getting-Started).

Details on configuration of the Markup Worker can be found [here](../markup-worker.md#configuration).

### Environment Variable Configuration

The worker container supports reading its configuration solely from environment variables. To enable this mode do not pass the `CAF_APPNAME` and `CAF_CONFIG_PATH` environment variables to the worker. This will cause it to use the default configuration files embedded in the container which check for environment variables. A listing of the RabbitMQ and Storage properties is available [here](https://github.com/WorkerFramework/worker-framework/tree/develop/worker-default-configs).

The Markup Worker specific configuration that can be controlled through the default configuration file is described below;

#### MarkupWorkerConfiguration
